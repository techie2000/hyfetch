neofetch with pride flags <3

<img alt="screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22280294/197708447-ddee6db2-1017-48f2-b507-8ddf85acef0d.png">

### Running Updated Original Neofetch

This repo also serves as an updated version of the original `neofetch` since the upstream [dylanaraps/neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) isn't maintained anymore and has been archived. If you only want to use the updated neofetch without pride flags, you can use the `neofetch` script from this repo. To prevent command name conflict, I call it `neowofetch` :)

* Method 1: Install HyFetch from PyPI (`pip install -U hyfetch`, `pipx install hyfetch`, or `uv tool install hyfetch`) then run `neowofetch`
* Method 2: `npx neowofetch`
* Method 3: `P="$HOME/.local/bin/neowofetch" && curl -L nf.hydev.org -o "$P" && chmod +x "$P"`
* Method 4: Run without install `bash <(curl -sL nf.hydev.org)`


## Installation

### Method 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

Even though hyfetch has been rewritten in Rust since 2.0.0, we also published PyPI packages with prebuilt rust binaries to allow seamless transition from the Python version. You can install the rust binaries using pip:

```sh
pip install wheel
pip install -U hyfetch
```

For isolated command installs, you can use pipx or uv:

```sh
pipx install hyfetch
uv tool install hyfetch
```

If a rust binary is not available for your platform (e.g. riscv64), it will automatically fall back to the v1.99.0 Python version.

### Method 2: Install using system package manager

Currently, these distributions have existing packages for HyFetch:

* Universal [Lure.sh](https://lure.sh/): `lure in hyfetch` (Thanks to [@Elara6331](https://github.com/Elara6331))
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S hyfetch` (Thanks to [@Aleksana](https://github.com/Aleksanaa) and [@Antiz96](https://github.com/Antiz96))
* Fedora Linux: `sudo dnf install hyfetch` (packaged by [@topazus](http://github.com/topazus))
* Nix: `nix-env -i hyfetch` (Thanks to [@YisuiDenghua](https://github.com/YisuiDenghua))
* Nix Profile: `nix profile install nixpkgs#hyfetch`
* Guix: `guix install hyfetch` (Thanks to [@WammKD](https://github.com/WammKD))
* Slackware: `sbopkg -b hyfetch` [Slackbuild](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/desktop/hyfetch/?search=hyfetch) (Thanks to [@bittin](https://github.com/bittin) , willysr (https://github.com/willysr), jebrhansen and Urchlay and new maintainer MDKDIO)
* Homebrew: `brew install hyfetch` (Thanks to [@catumin](https://github.com/catumin) and [@osalbahr](https://github.com/osalbahr))
* openSUSE Tumbleweed: `zypper in python311-hyfetch` (Thanks to [@catumin](https://github.com/catumin))
* Gentoo: `emerge --ask app-misc/hyfetch` (Thanks to [@catumin](https://github.com/catumin))
* Debian and Ubuntu `apt install hyfetch` (for Debian flavor >= [Trixie](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/hyfetch), Ubuntu flavor >= [Noble](https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/hyfetch)) (Thanks to [@catumin](https://github.com/catumin))

### Method 3: Install using Cargo

Since hyfetch has been rewritten in Rust since 2.0.0, you can now install it using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install hyfetch
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you install using Cargo, you would need to manually install dependencies like fastfetch if you want to use it as the backend, and Git Bash if you're on Windows.
>
> The PyPI package has all the dependencies bundled, so it's recommended to use that instead.

## Usage

When you run `hyfetch` for the first time, it will prompt you to choose a color system and a preset. Just follow the prompt, and everything should work (hopefully). If something doesn't work, feel free to submit an issue!

If you want to use the updated `neofetch` without LGBTQ flags, check out [this section](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch#running-updated-original-neofetch)


## Questions and answers

#### Q: How do I change my config?

A: Use `hyfetch -c`

#### Q: What do I do if the color is too dark/light for my theme?

A: You can try setting the colors' "lightness" in the configuration menu. The value should be between 0 and 1. For example, if you are using dark theme and the rainbow flag is too dark to display, you can set lightness to 0.7.

Feel free to experiment with it!

#### Q: Why do you use pride flag's coloring? I don't think it looks nice at all.

A: The core idea behind HyFetch coloring isn't just to make logos look nicer, it's about representation and identity. While it's okay to assess the visual appeal, you also need to understand that the LGBTQ+ flag colors serves a much deeper purpose than just aesthetics.

For many in the LGBTQ+ community, these flags symbolize their identity, struggles, and pride. Integrating these symbols into a showcase of the tech specs they share can provide a sense of empowerment. It's combining their enthusiasm for their favorite distro / hardware with their LGBTQ+ identity.

Also, by including flag coloring along with the updated neofetch, we're also broadcasting a wider message about the importance of inclusivity and representation. It's not just a design choice, it's a statement that promotes awareness and understanding toward the LGBTQ+ community.

#### Q: When I use `hyfetch` or `neowofetch` in my MotD, no art displays. How do I get the art back?

A: Most likely, the `stdout` detection is set to auto and is removing the ascii art and colors. To change this, you can: set `args` in your hyfetch.json to `"--stdout=off"`, add `--stdout=off` to the `neowofetch` command in your motd script, or set the option in $HOME/.config/(neofetch|neowofetch)/config.conf to off.

#### Q: How can I run HyFetch on Windows?

A: Install Python > 3.7 and Git > 2.42.0 first. Then, either open Git Bash terminal or install a terminal emulator that can display RGB colors (the default Windows cmd.exe cannot, but the new [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US) can). Then, run `pip install hyfetch`, `pipx install hyfetch`, or `uv tool install hyfetch` and run `hyfetch`.

### 2.0.1

(changelog is generated by Gemini from commit history)

**🦀 The Rust Rewrite!**

This is a massive update, rewriting the entire hyfetch core from Python to Rust for significantly improved performance, reliability, and maintainability. A huge thank you to **@teohhanhui** and all the contributors who made this possible!

* 🚀 **Complete Rewrite in Rust**: The entire codebase has been ported to Rust, resulting in major performance improvements and a smaller binary size.
* ⚙️ **New Backends**: In addition to neofetch and fastfetch, hyfetch now supports **macchina** as a backend option.
* 🌈 **Improved June Animation**: The `--june` pride month animation is now smoother, flicker-free ([#408](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/pull/408)).
* 🪟 **Native Windows Support**: The Rust version provides much-improved support for Windows.

**✨ Features & Enhancements**

* 🎨 **Automatic Theme Detection**: Hyfetch can now automatically detect your terminal's light/dark mode (when auto_detect_light_dark is true) ([#380](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/pull/380)).

* **General**: Fixed numerous bugs related to builds, path detection, cache handling, and distro name detection.
* **Formatting**: Fixed an unwanted space in the Python version output ([#401](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/pull/401)).

**🔧 Maintenance**

* **Documentation**: Updated the README with additional credits for Slackware contributors ([#365](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/pull/365)).
* **Build System**: Overhauled the build scripts for Rust, including support for `musl` static builds and cross-compilation for macOS and Windows.

### 1.99.0

This version would be the last version of HyFetch on Python as we migrate to Rust (Huge thanks to everyone on [#317](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/pull/317)!). It will also be an effort to start a transition that phases out the neowofetch/neofetch backend in favor of FastFetch, since the time needed to maintain the NF backend currently exceed our capacity. If you are willing to help maintaining it, please let us know!

Neofetch is a command-line system information tool written in `bash 3.2+`. Neofetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system. Neofetch shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's logo. You can further configure Neofetch to instead use an image, a custom ASCII file, your wallpaper or nothing at all.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lUrkQBN.png" alt="neofetch" align="right" height="240px">

You can further configure Neofetch to display exactly what you want it to. Through the use of command-line flags and the configuration file you can change existing information outputs or add your own custom ones.


Neofetch supports almost 150 different operating systems. From Linux to Windows, all the way to more obscure operating systems like Minix, AIX and Haiku. If your favourite operating system is unsupported: Open up an issue and support will be added.
